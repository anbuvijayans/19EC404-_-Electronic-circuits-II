### **Result**

Thus the current series  feedback amplifier is designed and constructed  and the following parameters are calculated.
| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency |f1 =54H |f1'' =3.54HZ |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency |f2 =1.5MHZ |f2'' =550HZ |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl =1.495MHZ \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l =54654HZ \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} =216.52 \) | \( A'{v(mid)} =11.12 \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point |18.75 |7.86|

---

**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the current series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
