## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | 0.0170khz | 0.065khz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | 110khz | 1000khz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 109.98khz\) | \( BW = f'h - f'l = 999.935khz\) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 1.12V\) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 940mV\) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 0.79 | 0.66 |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
